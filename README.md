# BCG Customer Churn Analysis for PowerCo

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for PowerCo, a utility company. Using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, the project aims to predict which customers are likely to leave the service (churn), allowing for targeted interventions to retain high-value customers.
# Features

    Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses customer data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
    Churn Prediction Models: Implements multiple machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict customer churn.
    Model Evaluation: Compares models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    Customer Segmentation: Identifies key customer segments that are at high risk of churning.
    Actionable Insights: Provides data-driven recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer retention strategies.

# Requirements

    Python 3.8+
    Required libraries are listed in requirements.txt. Install them with:

    bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/Sreejeet1998/BCG-Customer-Churn-for-PowerCo.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd BCG-Customer-Churn-for-PowerCo

Install the required dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Data Preparation: Ensure that you have the PowerCo customer data in the correct format (e.g., CSV).
    Train the Model: Run the script to train the churn prediction model:

    bash

python train_model.py --data powerco_data.csv

Evaluate the Model: After training, evaluate the model performance using test data:

bash

python evaluate_model.py --test test_data.csv

Generate Insights: Analyze the results to understand key factors driving customer churn and generate actionable insights:

bash

    python generate_insights.py

# Customization

The project is modular, allowing you to experiment with different machine learning algorithms, adjust preprocessing steps, or fine-tune hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.
